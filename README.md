# Building an Application Using Layouts and Navigation
A typical mobile application often has several pages, and these pages need to be wired together in the right manner using navigation and routing. In this app, you will learn how Flutter uses a stack data structure to enable navigation. New pages that you navigate to are pushed on top of the stack and navigating backward involves popping from the stack.

You will use the Navigator class to navigate to new pages, and see how you can improve the readability and robustness of your navigation code by using named routes. You will pass arguments to pages while navigating to them, and also see how you can use the route generator for navigation. Next, you will bring together everything that you've learned in this path to build a simple application for an e-commerce company, a shopping app.

The app will display products and categories, and allow you to add and remove products from the cart. You will build this app using material designed for Android devices and Cupertino widgets for iOS devices. Finally, you will see how you can connect a real device to Flutter and test your app on a real mobile phone.
